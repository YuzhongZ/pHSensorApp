# pHSensorApp

This project is currently in progress. It involves the development of an Android app for the WHOI pH sensor project in collaboration with Yapeng Teng, Hunter Adams, and Jonathan. The purpose of the app is to receive data from a pH device via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and upload the collected data to our cloud database (http://34.201.171.96/).
